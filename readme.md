This repo contains my implementation of a bayesian classifier (Zemmour et al., 2018) that assign the most likely Immgen immune cell profile to single cell RNAseq transcriptomes. Immgen is used here as an example, the classifier can be used with any other transcriptional profiles.

See in-line comments for more details.
